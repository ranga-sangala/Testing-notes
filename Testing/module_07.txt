Non functional Testing:
         Once the application functionality is stable then we do non-functional testing.
          It mainly focuses on customer expectations
          It focuses on performance, load it can take and security etc.
          separate environment, separate skill sets are required to perform non functional testings

 Performance Testing :
          speed of the application 
           we perform load, stress, volume testings 
           
           Load testing : Gradually  Increasing the load on the application slowly then check the speed of the application.
           Stress Testing: Suddenly increasing the load on the application and check the speed of the application 
           Volume Testing: Checking the how much data can be handled by the application 

security Testing: 
        We test how secure our application 
        Authentication: users are valid or not ex: Login 
        Authorization/ Access control :    permissions of the valid users 


Recovery Testing: 
            Checking the system change abnormal to normal 

Compatibility Testing:
             Forward Compatibility -- upgraded versions
            Backward Compatibility --- Versions change to previous versions    software compatibility both forward and backward 
            Hardware Compatibility -- configuration Testing 

Installation Testing: 
           Testing the process of installation 
           Screens and navigations are clear to understand or not 
           Un-installation process 

Sanity Or Garbage Testing :
             extra functionality apart from customer requirement 
             if any application provides extra feature or functionality then we consider them as bug.


Differences between functionality and non functionality testing 
   Functionalaity                          Non-functionality

*   Validates functionality of software    * Validates  performance,security,reliability of the software 
*  Functionality describes what software does * Non-functionality describes how software works
* Concentrates on user requirement              * concentrates on user expectations
* functional testing takes place before non functional  * non- functional testing performed after finishing functional testing
