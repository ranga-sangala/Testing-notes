Software Test Design Techniques.
          Test design Techniques heps to design better test cases 
           Reduce the no of testcases to be executed.
          Test desing Techniques are used to prepare data for testing.
          there
           Reduce the Data 
           More Coverage

There are 5 test design Techniques
    Equivalence class partitioning
    Boundary value analysis
    Decision Table based testing.
    State Transition 
    Error guessing.


Equivalence Class Partitioning:
            Partitioning data into various classes and we can select data according to class then test.
            It reduce the no of test-cases and save time for testing.
            value check 
            classify / divide / partition data into multiple test classes .
            ex: Enter a number ____  allow digits from 1--500 

            Normal Test Data : 1,2,3,4,.....500 

            Divide values into equivalence classes:
                                            Test data using ECP 

            -100 to 0 ---> -50   Invalid data                 -50
            1 to 100 --> 30 
            101 to 200 --> 160 
            201 to 300 -> 250
            301 to 400 --> 320 
            401 to 500 --> 450 
            501 to 600 --> 550 Invalid data  


            Ex : Name : ------ allow only alphabets 

            Divide values into eqivalence classes 
            A....Z   ---> XYZ
            a....z    ---> zyz
            special char --> @%
            spaces --> 250 xy z 
            Numbers ---> 320   1234 



    Boundary Value Analysis:

            BVA techinque used to check the boundaries of the input 

            Ex Enter a age : ----- allow digits from 18 to 35 

                 MIN = 18      max = 35 
                 min -1 = 17 fail    max - 1 = 34 pass 
                 min + 1 = 19 pass  max+1 = 36 fail 
    
           MIN, MIN + 1, MIN- 1 , MAX , MAX-1 , MAX +1 these are values we test BVA 

    These techquies(ECP,BVA) are used in Input domain testing.
      The value wiil be verified in the text box/ input fields.


    DECISION TABLE :
         Decision table is also called Cause-effect table.
         This technquie will be used if we have more conditions and corresponding actions.
         In this technique, we deal with combinations of inputs.
         To identify the test cases with decision table, we consider conditions and actions.
         IF WE HAVE more no of conditions and actions then we use decision tables.
         Ex:  Transfering money online to an account which is already added and approved.
               conditons:
                  account already approved.
                  OTP matched.
                  Sufficient money in the account.
                Actions:
                   Transfer money.
                   Show a message as insufficinet amount
                   Block the transaction incase of suspicious transaction.
    
    STATE TRANSITION:
         In State Transition technique changes in input conditons change the state of the application.
         This technique allows the tester to test the behaviour of AUT.
         THis tester can perform this action by entering various input conditions in a sequence.
         In state transition technqie, the testing team provides positive as well as negative input test values for evaluating the system behaviour.
    
     Example :
        login page of an application which locks the user name after three wrong attempts of the password.

    
    Error Guessing:
         Error guessing is one of the testing techinque used to find bugs in a software application based on testor's prior experience.
         In error quessing we dont follow any specific rules.
         It depends on Tester analytical skills and experience.

         some of the examples :
            Submitting form without enteing values.
            Entering ivalid values such as entering alphabets in the numeric fields.
